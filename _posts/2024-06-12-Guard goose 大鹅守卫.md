title: "Guard goose 大鹅守卫"
---

大鹅有很强的领地意识，对声音敏感，会对接近的陌生人会发出强烈的噪音，有的时候会比狗更具攻击性。由于它们成本更低，并且不会像狗一样接受「贿赂」，大鹅甚至在巴西被用来替代狗作为监狱守卫。

> Due to their tendency to make noise when approached by strangers, about 500 geese were used to supplement dogs, drones, and humans to patrol the 533-km boundary between [Chongzuo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chongzuo "Chongzuo") and [Vietnam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam "Vietnam") during the [COVID-19 pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic "COVID-19 pandemic"). An official commented that the birds, one of the most common livestock in the region, are sensitive to sounds and can sometimes be more aggressive than dogs.[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guard_goose#cite_note-19)

> Guard geese are utilized to monitor the fence at prisons in Brazil for incursions because of their low cost, and the fact that they don't respond to food bribes like dogs.[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guard_goose#cite_note-20)
